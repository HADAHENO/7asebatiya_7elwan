# Our Journey in Audio Data Processing 🎧

## Introduction

Our journey started by learning how to deal with audio data, focusing on feature extraction and preprocessing. We began our studies with the [Hugging Face course for audio](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter0/introduction).

## Deepening Knowledge 📚

Next, we deepened our knowledge by reading books like [Deep Learning for NLP and Speech Recognition](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-14596-5).

## Exploring ASR Implementations 🔍

Afterwards, we explored blogs discussing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and its implementation. We experimented with various approaches and searched for state-of-the-art architectures. This led us to NVIDIA's NeMo library, which offers state-of-the-art models. We chose QuartzNet as our model.

## Challenges and Solutions 🚧

We faced several challenges, such as limited computational resources. To address this, we used Kaggle to access GPUs and created multiple accounts to maximize our training capabilities. Despite these efforts, training the model was difficult.

## Language Model Training Attempt 🤖

Additionally, we attempted to train a language model (LM) to assist the ASR model, but we did not succeed.

## Future Focus 🔮

In the next phase, we will focus more on spelling correction to achieve better results.
